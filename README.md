stats.mensual_stats(model_cls_obj)

The method to generate statistical reports for the second stage models based on  each specified month in second stage data

---
---
## Parameters:

**model_cls_obj**

Input model class object

---
---
---
# class plots ( )

The method to generate the model class plots

---
---
## Methods:

* best_estimator_plots ( )

* partial_dep_plots ( )

* isotopes_meteoline_plot ( )

---
---
---
# plots.best_estimator_plots()

plots.best_estimator_plots( `cls, st1=True, st2=True` )

The method to plot the model class best estimators 

---
---
## **Parameters:**

**st1** boolean default=`True`

Generate plots for stage one regression models of the model class


**st2** boolean default=`True`

Generate plots for stage one regression models of the model class

---
---
---
# plots.partial_dep_plots( )

plots. partial_dep_plots(`cls,st1=True,st2=True`)

The method to plot the partial dependency of the features of the model class

---
---
## **Parameters:**

**st1** boolean default=`True`

Generate plots for stage one regression models of the model class


**st2** boolean default=`True`

Generate plots for stage two regression models of the model class

---
---
---
# plots.isotopes_meteoline_plot ( )

plots.isotopes_meteoline_plot( `ev_class, iso_class, var_list, iso_18=None, iso_2h=None, a=8, b=10, obs_data=False, residplot=False` )

The method to plot the (meteorological) line between  two features (isotopes) that are determined in var_list

---
---
## **Parameters:**

**ev_class** evaluation class

evaluation class that contains the second stage models predictions

---
**iso_class** model class

model class that contains the second stage models

---
**iso_18** none type or Pandas Dataframe default=`None`

First feature (isotope) observed raw data. Ignored if obs_data=`False`

---
**iso_2h** none type or Pandas Dataframe default=`None`

Second feature (isotope) observed raw data. Ignored if obs_data=`False`

---
**var_list** list of strings

List of strings that identifies the names of two features in the evaluation and model class (in stage two)

---
**a** float default=`8`

Coefficient of the line

---
**b** float default=`10`

Intercept of the line

---
**obs_data** boolean default=`False`

`False` if iso_18 and iso_2h are not observed data.
`True` if the predictions in evaluation class have an specified date, in `"month"` field.

* *EXAMPLE:*

    ```python
    pred_inputs=model_class.all_preds[["CooX","CooY","CooZ","month","ID"]].reset_index()
    ev_class_obs=tools_copy.evaluation()
    ev_class_obs.predict(model_class,pred_inputs,direc=direc)
    tools_copy.plots.isotopes_meteoline_plot(ev_class_obs,model_class,var_list=['is1','is2'],obs_data=True)
    ```
---
**residplot** boolean default=`False`

Ignored if obs_data=`False`. It create residual plots in each month for each ID.
